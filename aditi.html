  <h3>A message from the whole group!</h3>
  <p>She is quiet but she is fun, she is practical and extremely grounded, she is introverted but mixes well with people. She loves to hang out and movies and series are her favourite pass time. She doesn’t want to get married😂(lets see!). She loves physics and mythology. She loves reading books and you can equate her with schandler from FRIENDS. Everything she has and does is from and by her dada and tai.
    Everyone agrees on this!🤐😋</p>
