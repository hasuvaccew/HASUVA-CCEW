    <h3>A message from the whole group!</h3>
    <p>She is the Karan Johar(for Gossip) of our group. She cant keep a thing as secret but she knows that thin line that’s all matters. She is fun and calculated, doesn’t do anything out of impulse. She thinks a lot about events and literally didn’t post anything on Instagram for months because she never found that perfect first picture. She likes to have fun but is extremely career oriented and one day before the exam she can explain you how to remember that complex answer.
      Everyone agrees on this!🤐😋</p>
