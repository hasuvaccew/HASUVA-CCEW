    <h3>A message from the whole group!</h3>
    <p>She is a talkative, mostly zoned out and always sweet. Her smile can mend bridges. She is smart and interesting. She likes pizza and diet. She does it all. She accomplishes what she sets out for and is extremely dedicated (which can actually inspire everyone). She reflects and improves herself. You can talk to her anytime on anything!
      Everyone agrees on this!ü§êüòã</p>
