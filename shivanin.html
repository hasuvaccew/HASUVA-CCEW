    <h3>A message from the whole group!</h3>
    <p>She is disciplines and motivated! A little strict but focussed. She is an amazing friend who is always ready to help. She talks less of non sense and always takes inspiration and works hard. She is careful with everything. She gets the best dosas and chutney. She brings very little sabji but always is ready to get whatever we demand without complains. We are really grateful to have her as a par of this group.
      Everyone agrees on this!🤐😋</p>
